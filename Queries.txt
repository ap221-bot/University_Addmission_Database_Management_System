Hello, This Document for How Queries of our Project Runs.......
 
LOGIN AND SIGNUP::::---

Firstly We have Login Page Where We have all required Login information
There We Have Two Tables Called admins and students

For Inserting Information in Database We use Below Queries::

QUERY ------->  insert  into admins values(%s,%s,%s)

For Retrieve Information in Database We use Below Queries::

QUERY ------->  select * from admins where admin_id = %s
        We Fetch all Information from Table and Use It for Password Correction

This Process is  For Admin and it's Same For Student Too....

ALL OTHER OPERATION::::---

You Know After admins and students Table We Have Another Three Table Called ::
                                                                  1) STDB
                                                                  2) Preference
                                                                  3) Qualification
For Inserting The Data Into This Three Table For Simplicity Purpose We Use Three Different(ADD BUTTON)
Queries Written Below::

QUERY ------->  insert  into STDB values(%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s)
QUERY ------->  insert into preference values(%s,%s,%s,%s)
QUERY ------->  insert into qualification values(%s,%s,%s,%s)
                                                           
UPDATE BUTTON::
           Here We Can't Use Inner Join Because Of Attribute Required For Join Is In Where Clause 
        
QUERY ------->  update STDB set student_id=%s,name=%s,email=%s,gender=%s,contact=%s,dob=%s,Address=%s where app_id=%s
QUERY ------->  update preference set pref1=%s,pref2=%s,pref3=%s where app_id=%s
QUERY ------->  update qualification set type=%s,rank=%s,marks=%s where app_id=%s

DELETE BUTTON::
           Here We Can't Use Inner Join Because Of Attribute Required For Join Is In Where Clause
QUERY ------->  delete from preference where app_id=%s
QUERY ------->  delete from qualification where app_id=%s
QUERY ------->  delete from STDB where app_id=%s"

Here We Need To Delete Data from SubTables First

FETCH ALL THE DATA IN THIS THREE TABLES::

QUERY -------> select * from STDB inner join preference on STDB.app_id=preference.app_id
                                  inner join qualification on STDB.app_id=qualification.app_id;  

SEARCH BUTTON::

QUERY -------> select * from STDB inner join preference on STDB.app_id=preference.app_id
                                  inner join qualification on STDB.app_id=qualification.app_id
                                  where %s like '%s';
                                             (OR)
QUERY -------> select * from STDB where %s LIKE '%s'
From This I Can Take app_id From That I Can Seach Data From Preference And Qualification Table
QUERY -------> select pref1,pref2,pref3 from preference where app_id = %s
QUERY -------> select type,rank,marks from qualification where app_id = %s 

DELETE SPECIFIC STUDENT's ALL DATA Adding Account Too::

QUERY -------> delete STDB,preference,qualification from STDB inner join preference ON STDB.app_id=preference.app_id
                                                              inner join qualification ON STDB.app_id=qualification.app_id
                                                              where student_id = %s;
                                                              
QUERY ------->delete from students where student_id = %s

                                (OR)
                                
For This Firstly We need To Take All app_id(Application ID) Submit By Him/Her
After That For Each App_id We Need To Delete Student Data

QUERY ------->  select app_id from STDB where student_id = %s
QUERY ------->  delete from preference where app_id = %s
QUERY ------->  delete from qualification where app_id = %s
QUERY ------->  delete from STDB where app_id = %s
QUERY ------->  delete from students where student_id = %s

SEE DETAILS OF ONE USER::

QUERY ------->  select * from STDB where app_id = %s
QUERY ------->  select * from Preference where app_id = %s
QUERY ------->  select * from qualification where app_id = %s

CALCULATE MERIT BUTTON::

QUERY -------> SELECT COUNT(app_id) as count FROM qualification where type = %s AND rank <= %s
